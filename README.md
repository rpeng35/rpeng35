I am currently a fourth year student at UBC pursuing my Bachelor's of Science (Mathematics/Data Science).

I've attended several hackathons and gained a lot of technical skills and experience through these projects. I've worked on hardware projects like [haptic feedback gloves](https://github.com/jdesai840/SensiGlove) and [EchoSense](https://devpost.com/software/echosense) which enables user to gain the ability to use echolocation!
