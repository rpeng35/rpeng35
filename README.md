I am currently a second year student at UBC pursuing my Bachelor's of Science (Mathematics/Computer Science).

I've attended several hackathons and gained a lot of technical skills and experience through these projects. I've worked on hardware projects like [haptic feedback gloves](https://github.com/jdesai840/SensiGlove) and [EchoSense](https://devpost.com/software/echosense) which enables user to gain the ability to use echolocation! 
For more info about my hackathon projects click [here](https://devpost.com/rpeng35)

I am currently working on building a [crypto trading web appilcation](https://github.com/rpeng35/CryptoVisual) using Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and ta-lib/backtrader for analysis purposes. In the end, I hope to get a trading bot that does the trading for me!
